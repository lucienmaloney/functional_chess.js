# functional_chess.js

The rules of chess on their own can be hard to understand for a human, let alone in code. 
functional_chess.js is an attempt to make the mechanics of the game easier to understand using functional practices such as immutability and no side effects.
When completed, functional_chess.js should allow for simple and clean manipulation with different chess variants.

This program uses the functional javascript library ramda.js. Documentation can be found here: http://ramdajs.com/0.23.0/docs/
